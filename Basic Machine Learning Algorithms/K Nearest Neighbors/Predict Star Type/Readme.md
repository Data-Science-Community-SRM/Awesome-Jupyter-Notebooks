**<h1> Predicting Star Type using KNearestNeighbours</h1>**
    
This dataset is the best notebook for working on classification algorithms. One can use it to try and predict either Star type, Star Color or Spectral Class. In this notebook,we will be predicting the star type using KNearest Neighbours.There are 240 values in the dataset.
The dataset does not have any null values. Columns conatined in the dataset are:


*   Absolute Temperature (in K)
*   Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
*   Relative Radius (R/Ro)
*    Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
*    Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
*    Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
*    Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**

Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
